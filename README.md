## Description
New character from every class can be hired in the different random cities and villages, the same way as characters with original backgrounds. Player can combine original characters and new wow characters and use all of them in the battle. All characters should be leveled to the highest possible level.

WoW characters have separate talent tree. Talents (or perks) are implemented from different WoW specialization, for example Protection Spec Warrior talents and Arms Spec Warrior talents are be used in the same Perk Tree of Warrior. Player can select perks as he wants.

After certain conditions will be executed, Raid Dungeons should be added into the world. Raid or dungeon bosses from the World of Warcraft game will be met by player. If player want come in into dungeon, he should use only new characters of this modification. After all npc in dungeon will be killed, new raid places will appear in the world.

For the future the plan is to add WoW-like equipment in addition to standard weapons and equipment of this modification. Also such  equipment should be used by certain character classes and additional bonuses should be added to the user with full sets of equipments, as this is done by using raid sets of World of Warcraft.
